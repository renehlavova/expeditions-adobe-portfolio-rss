                <title>Autumn Dolomites: Chasing Larches Around Lago Federa</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/autumn-dolomites-chasing-larches-around-lago-federa</link>
                <description>This post will show a lot of photos of trees, sorry about that in advance 😅 But yes, I actually travelled to Italy to see trees. Specifically, golden larches. We chose Lago Federa because it’s one of the best places to see them in autumn. The plan was a 15-km circular trail with about 900 metres of elevation gain, supposedly doable in 5.5 hours. (Spoiler: it took us seven.)</description>

                <title>Gran Canaria: Where Mountains Meet Coast and Dunes</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/gran-canaria-where-mountains-meet-coast-and-dunes</link>
                <description>Gran Canaria surprised me with its variety. Steep mountains, quiet pine forests, and golden dunes by the sea. After Tenerife, which had set the bar pretty high (see post), we weren’t sure if this trip could match it. But over a week on the island, moving between viewpoints, coastal towns, and hiking trails that felt completely different every day, Gran Canaria easily held its own.</description>

                <title>1-Day Trip to Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland in Autumn</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/1-day-trip-to-bohemian-saxon-switzerland-in-autumn</link>
                <description>Autumn is my favourite season to visit Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland. The national park glows with golden colours and, with a bit of luck, the weather makes it magical. This was already our second visit, at the exact same late-October weekend as last year, and the once again, the weather did not disappoint. You can see photos from our first trip here. This time, we repeated our favourite full-day hike in Saxon Switzerland and added a few new, shorter stops on the Czech side of the park, which fit nicely into the itinerary.</description>

                <description>I love autumn photography. This time of year, I search for places with the most spectacular colors. Last year, I visited some well-known locations - check out this post to read more about them. This year, I set out to find hidden gems and less touristy spots.</description>

                <title>Brno: Many Years, Many Favourite Places</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/brno-many-years-many-favourite-places</link>
                <description>I've been living in Brno for the past 10 years. Sounds like a lot, and it is! I've experienced so much here: my university studies, my first jobs, and building true friendships ♡ I must have hiked every trail around Brno, especially during the COVID lockdowns. Since my time here marks a good anniversary, I decided to share my favourite spots in Brno for hiking, walking, good coffee or simply wandering around the city ☺︎P. S. I've included some older photos - some are a few years old and may not be the best quality, but bear with me!</description>

                <description>October in Czech republic is definitely my favourite. As the autumn reaches its peak, the landscape is transformed into a palette of warm orange and red colours. Here are some spots that are worth a visit, especially in autumn!</description>

                <title>Happy Island: Active Holidays on the Island of Rab</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/happy-island-active-holidays-on-the-island-of-rab</link>
                <description>Every year, we look forward to spending our holidays in Croatia, exploring different islands. Last year, we visited Ugljan; this year we randomly picked Rab. We like the slow island life, so we chose a location in northern Croatia to shorten our travel time.</description>

                <title>Austrian Alps: Trail to Schafberg</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/austrian-alps-trail-to-schafberg</link>
                <description>Me and my friend travelled to Austria this spring. With the weather being unpredictable at this time of the year, we were looking for a hiking trail that would be safe but challenging at the same time. Schafberg seemed to fit the bill perfectly. The altitude is not too high (1,783 m), but you essentially have to hike all the way up from Wolfgangsee. Schafberg is a mountain peak surrounded by three Austrian lakes - Mondsee, Attersee, and Wolfgangsee.</description>

                <description>Only five-hour ride, that didn't take long to decide for a roadtrip to Switzerland during Easter. We picked the nearest place with a lake in the Alps which happens to be Walensee. Although random, it turned out to be an amazing choice! The lake is amazing and there are many hiking routes and destinations around the lake.</description>

                <description>Two years ago, we hiked through Saxon Switzerland with my best friend during autumn while sleeping in the car. We were lucky that we had sunny weather throughout the whole trip, so the sceneries were truly beautiful in this part of the year. We arrived late afternoon to Pfaffendorf to do a quick hike to catch a sunset from Pfaffenstein (trail here).</description>

                <title>Roadtrip to Poland: What to see around Krakow</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/roadtrip-to-poland-what-to-see-around-krakow</link>
                <description>This trip to Poland was one of those random roadtrips we made because it was the only place nearby where it did not rain. And since we didn't want to waste our holidays, we headed east with no plan in mind. Recently, I bought a new ND filter which is the reason this post will contain mostly portraits and weird experiments. I mostly shoot landscapes but change is always a good practice ☺︎Also the photos were taken a year ago. It is crazy to see how much I progressed or changed my color grading and taste in general.</description>

                <description>July was the perfect month to go hiking in Slovak High Tatras. Our aim was to hike up the Koprovsky Stit (2,363 m). The hike starts at a large parking lot at Strbske pleso and takes you around several other lakes. It has a total elevation of approximately 1,100 m. The hike takes around 9-10 hours depending on your fitness level.</description>

We will be spending the first two weeks exploring the northern part with our base in Los Realejos. It is close to Puerto de Cruz with good bus connections, it is surrounded by huge mountains and green landscape.</description>

                <title>Two-Week Roadtrip in Greece: Top 3 Places to Visit</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/two-week-roadtrip-in-greece-top-3-places-to-visit</link>
                <description>Last year in September, we spent two weeks roadtripping around Greece, sleeping in campsites in a tiny Kia Ceed. I put up together a map with the route and all the places we visited. I must say two weeks are definitely not enough to visit all the beautiful places in Greece, but anyways was very well worth it. In this article, I choose my top three places from the whole trip that I recommend everyone to visit.</description>

                <title>One-Week Itinerary for Dublin in Autumn</title>
                <link>https://expeditions.renehlavova.com/one-week-itinerary-for-dublin-autumn</link>
                <description>October 2022, I visited a friend in Dublin. I spent most of the days hiking and drinking coffee, and I am glad that I managed to squeeze most of the natural wonders in one single week. I did not have a car, so I travelled mostly using public transport, though me and my friend also did one tour to the west coast.</description>

                <description>One year ago, I spent a month working remotely from Madeira. As much as I love autumn, November is a dark, grey, and cold month in Czechia so I decided to leave. ​​​​​​​</description>
